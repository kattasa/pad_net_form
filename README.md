# PAD Network Formation
1. `generative_algorithms.R` contains code for each of the generative network models evaluated
2. `network_characteristics_calculations.R` contains code to calculate summary statistics for the networks
3. Other `.R` files will create simulated networks
4. `rf_classification.Rmd` contains code for the model selection
5. `OLP_networks_desc.csv` contains meta data and real world networks evaluated
6. `sfanalysis_categorize_degree8000.csv` contains the results of the likelihood ratio tests
7. `pad_degree_dist_analysis.ipynb` contains the code to analyze simulated PAD degree distributions using LRT
